# Practical 10
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It is usually accurate however there are times when I finish faster/slower.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As Practicals stopped mentioning them, I forgot to include them in the files. However, I believe I have improved
due to practices done in class.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To finish within estimated time limit so I can estimate in exam while writing codes, and also
you get to know yourself how much can you do within the time limit.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That there is always alternative ways to code certain instructions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Giving good code reviews help me improve to notice the code patterns and help others know the alternatives.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would not want to change anything since every practical is precisely described and mentioned what to be done, still,
I want to change prac10 into revision sort of exercises for exams.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I read through instructions properly and did each step at a time to ensure I am doing correctly.
